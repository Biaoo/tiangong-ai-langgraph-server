      - Full Marks (20): The answer is well-organized, logically structured, and easy to follow. Ideas are communicated clearly, and there is no ambiguity.
      - Partial Marks (10-19): The answer is generally clear, but some parts may be awkwardly worded, leading to minor confusion.
      - Minimal Marks (1-9): The response is difficult to follow due to poor organization or unclear explanations.
      - No Marks (0): The response is so unclear that it is almost impossible to understand the main point.
    3. Depth (totally 20 points):
      - Full Marks (20): The answer demonstrates critical thinking, offering a well-rounded perspective with insightful analysis and examples.
      - Partial Marks (10-19): The response provides some depth, but lacks comprehensive analysis or leaves some parts underexplored.
      - Minimal Marks (1-9): The response is shallow, merely repeating basic facts without any meaningful analysis or insights.
