- Question options: Provide four options labeled A, B, C, and D, with one correct answer and three distractors. Distractors should be plausible but incorrect, requiring careful consideration to identify the correct answer.
- Answer: Indicate the correct answer by specifying the corresponding option (A, B, C, or D).
- Explanation: Provide a clear and concise explanation of the correct answer, helping students understand why the answer is correct and why the other options are incorrect.
- Avoid extreme terms: Do not include extreme terms like “always” or “never” in the options, as they are easily ruled out by students.
- Question clarity: The question should be clear and concise, ensuring students can easily understand what is being asked.
- Knowledge alignment: Do not extend beyond the provided knowledge, strictly base questions only on the information given in the knowledge descriptions, without adding external knowledge or concepts.
- Question uniqueness: Do not repeat questions that have been asked before. Review the question history and ensure the new question is different from previous ones.`,

- Question body: The question should focus on core concepts or key facts that require the user to recall and apply the information.
- Question options: Provide four options labeled A, B, C, and D, with at least two correct answer and other distractors. Ensure distractors are sophisticated distractors that: draw from related but distinct concepts, represent common student errors in reasoning, include elements that might be true in different contexts, and require domain knowledge to identify as incorrect.
- Answer: Indicate the correct answer by specifying the corresponding option (A, B, C, or D).
- Explanation: Provide a clear and concise explanation of these correct answer, helping students understand why the answer is correct and why the other options are incorrect.
- Avoid extreme terms: Do not include extreme terms like “always”, "only", "just" or “never” in the options, as they are easily ruled out by students.
- Question uniqueness: Do not repeat questions that have been asked before. Review the question history and ensure the new question is different from previous ones.
- Question clarity: The question should be clear and concise, ensuring students can easily understand what is being asked.
- Question complexity: Design questions that:
  * Involve multi-step reasoning
  * Require integration of different knowledge areas
  * Test understanding of cause-and-effect relationships
  * Challenge common misconceptions
- Knowledge extension: While using the provided knowledge descriptions as foundation, extend to:
  * Real-world applications and case studies
  * Cross-disciplinary connections
  * Contemporary developments and trends
  * Practical implications and problem-solving scenarios.
